#Rainfall Prediction Project

This project uses machine learning to predict rainfall for a future date or time period. The project uses a variety of data sources, including historical rainfall data, weather data, and climate data. The data is used to train a machine learning model to predict rainfall for a future date or time period.

The project can be used for a variety of purposes, such as flood forecasting, agricultural planning, and water resource management.

To use the project, simply provide the model with the input data for the future date or time period. The model will then output a prediction of the rainfall for that date or time period.

The project uses a variety of machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. The best algorithm to use will depend on the specific dataset and the desired results.

The project is implemented in Python and uses a variety of Python libraries, including scikit-learn, pandas, and NumPy.

Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
scikit-learn
pandas
NumPy
Usage
To use the project, simply follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required Python libraries.
Run the predict_rainfall.py script.
The script will prompt you to enter the following information:

The date or time period for which you want to predict rainfall.
The path to the input data file.
The path to the output prediction file.
Once you have entered this information, the script will train the machine learning model and predict rainfall for the future date or time period. The predictions will be saved to the output prediction file.
